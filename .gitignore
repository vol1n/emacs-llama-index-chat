#  For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#  intended to run in multiple environments; instead, the code should support
#  running in an environment where these files are not present.
#  See https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/issues/1068
#  If using a specific Python version for development, like 3.7.3, you might want
#  to ignore it to prevent other users from being locked to that version.
#  Change this line as necessary, but always consider your use case first.
